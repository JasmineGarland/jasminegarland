Jasmine Garland is currently pursuing her PhD at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder), in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering. She is a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow (NSF GRFP recipient) and Graduate Assistant in Areas of National Need (GAANN) Fellow,  co-advised by Dr. Kyri Baker and Dr. Ben Livneh. Her graduate research is at the confluence of climate change, extreme weather events, and the power grid. At large, her research interest is rooted in her passions for data science, mathematical modeling, and electrical energy issues. She hopes to one day become a professor and lead a diverse research group solving relevant energy issues through both simulation and application.

Prior to CU Boulder, Jasmine graduated from Appalachian State University, where she conducted research on  HVAC control systems. She worked as part of the Certification and Research Team at The Passive House Institute United States (PHIUS), where she conducted research regarding building energy modeling software and the development of modeling methods. Her most recent employment was at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO, for two years, where she worked in data analytics and modeling.
